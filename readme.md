# Brain Region Notes

Notes regarding cognitive neurolinguistics.

> A sample of notes that I have curated from various lectures and readings. These notes have been heavily abbreviated.

The notes lean towards the anatomy and physiology of regions and circuits involved in the perception and production of language.

The purpose of these notes is to have them serve as the foundation for the database that I am compiling for the [ling-brain](https://ling-brain.rubenasanchez.com) app I am developing.
